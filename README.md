# Playnite Multi-Install Plugin
This plugin adds a right-click menu option to install multiple selected games as Playnite only allows you to install one at a time currently.

Keep in mind that the UI gets a little laggy while installing games but it's still possible to cancel the installation as long as you click the cancel button.
